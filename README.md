### python

### The online documentation is your first port of call for definitive information. 
## There is a fairly brief tutorial that gives you basic information about the language and gets you started. 
## You can follow this by looking at the library reference for a full description of Python's many libraries and the language reference for a complete (though somewhat dry) explanation of Python's syntax. If you are looking for common Python recipes and patterns, you can browse the ActiveState Python Cookbook
